# Web GPU

## What is Web GPU?

Web GPU is a new API that exposes the GPU to the web. 

It is designed from the ground up to be more efficient than WebGL, and work better with modern hardware. 

It is also designed to expose more of the low-level functionality of the GPU, so that developers can make better use of the GPU.
